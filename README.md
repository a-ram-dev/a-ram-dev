Hey! I'm Alejandro.

I'm a Software QA based in Madison, Wisconsin USA. I have just completed my MS in Computer Sciences from UW-Madison! Previously I completed my undergrad at DePaul in Chicago. 

My research area is focused on Security & Privacy, and Systems. I prefer tinkering with things low level.

Hey! I'm Alejandro.

I'm a Software QA based in Chicago, IL working fully remote. In June of 2025 I completed my MS in Computer Sciences from UW-Madison. Previously I copmleted my undergrad at DePaul in Chicago.

My research area is focused on Security & Privacy, and Systems. I prefer tinkering with things low level.
